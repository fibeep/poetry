The purpose of this code is to read lines from a text element, and then rearrange them according to my criteria.

The first function rearranges the code backwards by adding 1 to the index of the lines (once converted into a list) and then
multiplying it by a negative, taking advantage of the negative indexing capabilities.

The second code uses the randint method from the random module
in order to randomly decide what index will print.

Finally, the last function uses logic to dinamically decide wether to print the even or odd lines of a text file based on how many lines the file has.
